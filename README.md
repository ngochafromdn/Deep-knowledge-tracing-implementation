# Deep-knowledge-tracing-implementation

Understanding how students learn as they interact with coursework, called knowledge tracing, is a difficult problem in computer-supported education. In this repo, I will share my work on tackling this task, including the implementation of previous model, evaluating its performance, and creating a user-friendly website to explain how my model works.
