        Welcome to the Question Accuracy Probability App!
        
        This app predicts the accuracy probability for the next question based on the previous questions and their accuracy. The model behind it is based on the Deep Knowledge Tracing model with Assistmentdata2015.
        
        For more information, please go to : https://github.com/ngochafromdn/Deep-knowledge-tracing-implementation
        
        Suppose you are a students answer 100 questions from the questions list, this app will help you predict the accuracy probability of your next questions based on the result of previous questions 
        
    
        To use the app, follow these steps:
        
        1. Enter a list of previous question indices in the format [1, 2, 3]. The indices should be within the range of 1 to 100.
        2. Enter the previous question accuracy list in the format [0, 1, 0]. Use 0 to indicate an incorrect answer and 1 to indicate a correct answer. The list should have the same length as the previous question indices.
        3. Select the next question index from the dropdown menu. The index should be within the range of 1 to 100.
        4. Click the **Submit** button to get the accuracy probability for the next question.
        
        Try it out now!
